** The Emacs series

This is fifth in a [[https://changelog.complete.org/archives/tag/emacs2018][series on Emacs and org-mode]].

This document was generated from [[https://github.com/jgoerzen/public-snippets/blob/master/emacs/emacs-org-beamer.org][an org-mode source]] and exported
as PDF slides and a blog page.

* About org-mode exporting
** Background

org-mode isn't just an agenda-making program.  It can also export to
lots of formats: LaTeX, PDF, Beamer, iCalendar (agendas), HTML,
Markdown, ODT, plain text, man pages, and more complicated formats
such as a set of web pages.

This isn't just some afterthought either; it's a core part of the
system and integrates very well.

One file can be source code, automatically-generated output, task
list, documentation, and presentation, all at once.

Some use org-mode as their preferred markup format, even for things
like LaTeX documents.  The org-mode manual has an extensive [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html#Exporting][section on
exporting]].

** Getting started

From any org-mode document, just hit =C-c C-e=.  From there will come
up a menu, letting you choose various export formats and options.
These are generally single-key options so it's easy to set and
execute.  For instance, to export a document to a PDF, use 
=C-c C-e l p= or for HTML export, =C-c C-e h h=.

There are lots of settings available for all of these export options;
see the manual.  It is, in fact, quite possible to use LaTeX-format
equations in both LaTeX and HTML modes, to insert arbitrary preambles
and settings for different modes, etc.

** Add-on packages

ELPA containts many addition exporters for org-mode as well.  Check
there for details.

* Beamer slides with org-mode
** About Beamer

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)][Beamer]] is a LaTeX environment for making presentations.  Its features
include:

 - Automated generating of structural elements in the
   presentation (see, for example, [[https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/all/beamer-albatross-Marburg-1.png][the Marburg theme]]).  This provides
   a visual reference for the audience of where they are in the
   presentation.
 - Strong help for structuring the presentation
 - Themes
 - Full LaTeX available

** Benefits of Beamer in org-mode

org-mode has a lot of benefits for working with Beamer.  Among them:

 - org-mode's very easy and strong support for visualizing and
   changing the structure makes it very quick to reorganize your
   material.
 - Combined with org-babel, live source code (with syntax
   highlighting) and results can be embedded.
 - The syntax is often easier to work with.

I have completely replaced my usage of
LibreOffice/Powerpoint/GoogleDocs with org-mode and beamer.  It is, in
fact, rather frustrating when I have to use one of those tools, as
they are nowhere near as strong as org-mode for visualizing a
presentation structure.

** Headline Levels

org-mode's Beamer export will convert sections of your document
(defined by headings) into slides.  The question, of course, is:
/which/ sections?  This is governed by the H [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html#Export-settings][export setting]]
(=org-export-headline-levels=).

There are many ways to go, which suit people.  I like to have my
presentation like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+OPTIONS: H:2
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \AtBeginSection{\frame{\sectionpage}}
#+END_EXAMPLE

This gives a standalone section slide for each major topic, to
highlight major transitions, and then takes the level 2 (two
asterisks) headings to set the slide.  Many Beamer themes expect a
third level of indirection, so you would set =H:3= for them.

** Themes and settings
You can configure many Beamer and LaTeX settings in your document by
inserting lines at the top of your org file.  This document, for
instance, defines:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+TITLE:  Documents and presentations with org-mode
#+AUTHOR: John Goerzen
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \institute{The Changelog}
#+PROPERTY: comments yes
#+PROPERTY: header-args :exports both :eval never-export
#+OPTIONS: H:2
#+BEAMER_THEME: CambridgeUS
#+BEAMER_COLOR_THEME: default
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Advanced settings

I like to change some colors, bullet formatting, and the like.  I
round out my document with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# We can't just +BEAMER_INNER_THEME: default because that picks the theme default.
# Override per https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11168/change-bullet-style-formatting-in-beamer
#+BEAMER_INNER_THEME: default
#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [aspectratio=169]
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \definecolor{links}{HTML}{0000A0}
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \hypersetup{colorlinks=,linkcolor=,urlcolor=links}
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \setbeamertemplate{itemize items}[default]
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \setbeamertemplate{enumerate items}[default]
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \setbeamertemplate{items}[default]
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \setbeamercolor*{local structure}{fg=darkred}
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \setbeamercolor{section in toc}{fg=darkred}
#+BEAMER_HEADER: \setlength{\parskip}{\smallskipamount}
#+END_EXAMPLE

These are probably mostly self-explanatory.  aspectratio=169 sets a
16:9 aspect ratio, and the remaining are standard LaTeX/Beamer
configuration bits.

** Result

Here's the end result:

* Interactive Slides
** Interactive Emacs Slideshows

With the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentations.html#org-tree-slide][org-tree-slide package]], you can display your slideshow from
right within Emacs.  Just run =M-x org-tree-slide-mode=.  Then, use
=C->= and =C-<= to move between slides.

You might find =C-c C-x C-v= (which is =org-toggle-inline-images=)
helpful to cause the system to display embedded images.

** HTML Slideshows

There are a lot of ways to export org-mode presentations to HTML, with
various levels of JavaScript integration.  See the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentations.html][non-beamer
presentations section]] of the org-mode wiki for details.
